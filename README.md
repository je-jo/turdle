# Turdle

## Context
Welcome to the Turdle Project! This project is designed to give you hands-on experience with working on an existing codebase, a common scenario in professional software development. Modeled after the popular game "Wordle," Turdle offers you the opportunity to dive into a pre-existing codebase, understand its functionality, identify and fix bugs, add new features, and refactor the code to improve its quality.  This repo is associated with the [Refactor Tractor - 1 Day Challenge activity](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/turdle.html).

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to help you become comfortable with modifying and enhancing an existing codebase. As a developer, you will frequently find yourself working with existing projects rather than starting from scratch. This exercise aims to build your confidence and skills in navigating, understanding, and improving unfamiliar code.
